# Website Design Notes (v0.1)

## Goal
A cohesive, futuristic-minimal website that can scale as Unity tools and games are added continuously, plus simple destinations for course redirect and personal info.

## Style DNA
- Dark-first, high-contrast, lots of negative space.
- One cool secondary color (#fb8114) used sparingly for emphasis
- Subtle grid/noise/gradient depth; clean, uncluttered surfaces.
- Card-based composition with consistent radius, borders, shadow, and blur rules.

## Motion
- Smooth, restrained transitions (fade + slight slide), consistent easing/timings.
- Micro-interactions clarify state: hover lift, border/ glow increase, crisp focus states.
- Scroll reveals are subtle and performant; respect reduced-motion.

## Components and Consistency
- Reusable system: buttons, badges (eg. “Available”, “Coming Soon”), cards, section headers.
- Design tokens drive spacing, typography scale, radii, shadows, and animation durations.
- Copy stays short, outcome-focused, and scannable.
