Version: 1.1
Last updated: 2026-02-14

Copyright (c) 2026 Bjorvand Solutions
Kevin Bjorvand
All rights reserved.

This License Agreement ("License") governs use of the Build Size Guard software package, including
all source code, editor scripts, binaries, UI, documentation, examples, and associated files
(collectively, the "Software").

PLATFORM NOTE (UNITY ASSET STORE)
If you obtained the Software via the Unity Asset Store, your use is governed primarily by the Unity
Asset Store End User License Agreement ("Unity EULA") and the license type you purchased there.
This License applies only as supplemental terms to the extent it does not conflict with the Unity EULA.
If a conflict exists, the Unity EULA controls.
If you obtained the Software via itch.io or direct sale, this License is the primary license.

1. DEFINITIONS
"Licensor" means Bjorvand Solutions (Kevin Bjorvand).
"Licensee" means the individual or legal entity that purchased or otherwise lawfully obtained the Software.
"Seat" means one (1) individual human user who is authorized to install, access, or use the Software
(including Editor tooling and CLI/batchmode features) for Licensee's benefit.
"Project" means a product or internal work created by Licensee (for example, a game, app, or tool).
"Redistribute" means to sell, resell, rent, lease, lend, sublicense, transfer, share, publish, or
otherwise make the Software available to any third party, whether in source or compiled form, whether
modified or unmodified, except as explicitly permitted below.

2. LICENSE GRANT
Subject to this License and payment of applicable fees, Licensor grants Licensee a non-exclusive,
non-transferable, revocable, per-seat license to install and use the Software solely for developing
and maintaining Licensee’s Projects.

3. SEAT COUNT AND AUTHORIZED USERS
3.1 Seat requirement
Licensee must have purchased a Seat for each individual who uses or accesses the Software.

3.2 Reassignment
Seats may be reassigned to a different individual only when the original assignee no longer uses the
Software (for example, role change or leaving the team). Reassignments must not be used to increase
concurrent usage beyond purchased Seats.

3.3 Contractors
Contractors count as Seats if they use or access the Software. Licensee is responsible for ensuring
contractors comply with this License.

3.4 Build servers and CI
Use of the Software on build machines or CI runners is permitted only to support Licensee’s Projects.
Such use does not require an additional Seat if:
  (a) it is used solely for automated builds/checks for Licensee’s Projects, and
  (b) it is configured and initiated by individuals covered by purchased Seats, and
  (c) the build/CI environment is not provided as a service to third parties.
If the Software is made available to third parties (for example, a hosted build gate service), that is
prohibited under Section 6.

4. PERMITTED MODIFICATIONS AND INTERNAL SHARING
Licensee may modify the Software for internal use.
Licensee may share the Software internally with employees and contractors only as necessary for work
on Licensee’s Projects, provided those recipients are bound by written obligations at least as
protective as this License. Contractors must delete all copies when their engagement ends or when no
longer needed for the Project, whichever occurs first.

5. DISTRIBUTION OF YOUR PROJECTS
Licensee may distribute finished Projects built using the Software, provided that the Software itself
is not redistributed as a standalone product, editor extension, toolkit, or otherwise separable
component, and Licensee does not enable third parties to extract, reuse, or access the Software.

6. PROHIBITED USES (NO RESELLING, NO REDISTRIBUTION)
Licensee must not, and must not allow others to:
  a) Redistribute, resell, or share the Software, including via any marketplace, asset pack,
     template project intended for redistribution, public or third-party-accessible repository,
     or file-sharing service.
  b) Sublicense, transfer, assign, or otherwise convey license rights to any other party.
  c) Offer the Software as a service, hosted tool, or part of a product where the primary value is
     the Software itself or where third parties gain access to the Software.
  d) Remove or obscure copyright, trademark, or proprietary notices.

7. OWNERSHIP
The Software is licensed, not sold. Licensor retains all right, title, and interest in and to the
Software and all intellectual property rights therein. Licensee retains ownership of Licensee’s Projects.

8. COMPLIANCE AND RECORDS
Upon reasonable request, Licensee will confirm the number of Seats in use and the number purchased.
Licensor may request a written certification of compliance. No access to Licensee systems is required.

9. SUPPORT
Support is best-effort only, with no guaranteed response time or service level.

10. WARRANTY DISCLAIMER
THE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED "AS IS" AND "AS AVAILABLE", WITH ALL FAULTS.
TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, LICENSOR DISCLAIMS ALL WARRANTIES, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED,
INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE,
AND NON-INFRINGEMENT. LICENSEE ASSUMES ALL RISK ARISING OUT OF USE OR PERFORMANCE OF THE SOFTWARE.

11. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY
TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, IN NO EVENT WILL LICENSOR BE LIABLE FOR ANY INDIRECT,
INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, OR EXEMPLARY DAMAGES, OR FOR ANY LOSS OF PROFITS, REVENUE, DATA,
BUSINESS INTERRUPTION, OR GOODWILL, ARISING OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH THE SOFTWARE OR THIS LICENSE,
EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.
TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, LICENSOR’S TOTAL LIABILITY FOR ANY CLAIM WILL NOT EXCEED THE
AMOUNT PAID BY LICENSEE FOR THE SOFTWARE IN THE TWELVE (12) MONTHS PRECEDING THE EVENT GIVING RISE TO
THE CLAIM.

12. TERMINATION
This License terminates automatically if Licensee breaches any term. Upon termination, Licensee must
cease use of the Software and delete all copies in Licensee’s possession or control, including copies
held by contractors, except where retention is required by law.

13. MISCELLANEOUS
If any provision of this License is held unenforceable, the remaining provisions will remain in effect.
This License is the entire agreement regarding the Software for non-Unity-Asset-Store sales and
supersedes prior discussions or understandings on that subject.
